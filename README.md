## Development server

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Deployment

To deploy the production build to a live server on cloud, Run `npm run deploy`. This will push the `dist/knowledgebase` directory to `gh-pages` branch, which is used by [netlify](https://www.netlify.com) to deploy the application.
